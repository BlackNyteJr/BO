        My name is Damyan Maxwell, I am 16 years old.
        I was born and raised in Aruba for 13 years then I moved to Bonaire and lived there for one and a half years.
        After Bonaire I moved to The Netherlands with my mom and little sister to start a new.

    <p2 style="text-align: left;"> 
        I currently live in Amsterdam with my mom and little sister and my cat Kenzo.
        When we arrived we weâ€™re living with my big sister for a while.
        It was a bit hard in the beginning but we managed.
        I moved mid school year so I had to wait for the next one to begin.
        When it began I was in Havo 3 at Montessori Lyceum Oostpoort.
        When school started my Dutch was still lacking training but I understood it.
        Then I just progressed further and kept pushing. Till I got to the point that I am today.
        I live in Nieuwe West in Osdorp. The place where I live is pretty calm.
        Everything we need is close by, well not everything everything but most of the stuff that we need.
        We like it there. I even found a job really close by. So its chill.

    <h2 style="text-align: right;">In my free time</h2>
    <p3 style="text-align: right;">
        In my free time I game a lot. Sometimes also with friends and we just chill with each other and have fun.
        Sometimes I go out with friends or just alone when I want to calm myself.
        Sometimes I sketch but not much. It gets boring most of the times.

    <h2 style="text-align: left;">What can I do</h2>
    <p4 style="text-align: left;">
        I can play dodgeball very good. I can also speak 4 languages, those being English, Spanish, Dutch and Papiamento.
        Papiamento is my native language. Barely anyone has heard of it. Its not even on the internet
